Objective of the episode: Tell the story of one person currently in the process of breaking into tech. But someone is on the right track. I want to witness and feel how it feels to be on the right track, but I still need to get there.

We will with big failures, like when Leo quit university and didn't know what to do. He was introduced to coding in the worst possible way, using the worst possible language to learn. He hated it back then.

In our discussion, one of the best takeaways was how in his past, he learned a process to learn and a process to troubleshoot that shaped him in a way that he is ready to code. He developed:
- Logical thinking
- Reading skills
- Following instructions
- Google skills, research skills.
