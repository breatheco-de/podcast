"Coding sets you free" is a tech-culture podcast where you learn to become a successful professional in tech today and for the next 2 decades. Get into the tech world, learn the skills, and navigate the typical challenges in tech: Motivate yourself, learn skills, find jobs, network, learn how to use AI, keep up to date, and break entry barriers.

The podcast will have weekly episodes alternating languages between english and spanish.

The podcast tone will be antagonic, truth-telling, hardcore, informal, and a bit humorous or ironic.

Episode titles must append the language name wrapped in parenthesis.

The podcast is for people aged from 20 to 35 years old, who want to or are learning to code, and who are developing projects today want to make the transition to becoming coders, data scientists, cybersecurity specialists, or other code-heavy-oriented careers.

Here is a list of general topics that will be covered by the podcast: 
- Artificial Inteligence and how it may threaten our jobs.
- Barriers of entry into tech
- How to keep motivated while transitioning to tech.
- Most effective ways to learn code and other tech skills.
- Finding a job in tech.
- Tech Culture and news about what is happening.

We want the podcast to have the following values: Resilience, Confidence, Work Ethic, Self-Improvement. 
And the following anti-values: Complaining, Procrastination, etc. 

Each episode script must have: One or several enemies, a protagonist and a story.

Each episode must be structured this way:

- Exposition: Introduce the setting, characters, and the main conflict or issue.
- Rising Action: Build tension through a series of events that escalate the conflict.
- Climax: The turning point where the protagonist faces the main conflict or enemy.
- Falling Action: Events following the climax leading towards resolution.
- Resolution: Conclude the story, resolving the conflicts. Leave room for future episodes if itâ€™s a series.

The podcast listeners are the protagonists in a war against themselves and others, here is a list of all the enemies:

- Yourself: Impostor syndrome, insecurities, and other mental challenges.
- Recruiters that don't event know how to recognize talent, don't understand code or what they are asking, they ask for 10 years of experience when the technology has been in the market for 5 years only, or they publish a junior dev opening with implausible requirements.
- Tech companies with impossible interview challenges that test for skills you will never use again in your job or life. Or companies that may hire you but don't want to pay any salary because you don't have experience.
- Shitty bosses that don't want to give you opportunities to grow; they rather pay you less and keep you in your current role.
- Youtuber's: They do videos that make everything look easy, they make 6 hour videos impossible to follow, they publish course after course like you will win if you learn 100 languages and tools.
- Job portals: almost all of them are broken, badly implemented, it's impossible to be visible, its to easy to apply so everyone applies without reading, etc.
- Other applicants: always lying on their resumes
- The government: with inmigration laws that block your opportunities.
- Influencers: Usually giving you innocent or toxic advice like: Asking you to learn millions of libraries, telling you that if you don't learn X or Y you will be left behind, or involving you on stupid language wars (E.g: PHP vs JS), or talking about fancy computer setups,
- Toxic family and friends that don't support you or give you a hard time when you need to focus on learning.

Here is a few ideas for possible episodes:
- Bringing a guest who is highly credible: Either they are very successful in tech or they have had a recent important success related to one of the main topics of the podcast.
- A former guest who has gotten a job at a prestigious company.
- Discuss the results of some research we have done or someone else has done. Review of open job positions.
- Industry news but it must be very fresh, explaining something that's happening in tech.
Challenge of the week (5 minutes): record a challenge, a project for the week, with justification for why we are proposing that challenge.
