## Typical enemies:

Listeners will be the protagonist in a war against themselves for allowing stupid mental constructs like:
- Yourself: Impostor syndrome, insecurities, and other mental challenges.
- Recruiters that don't event know how to recognize talent, don't understand code or what they are asking, they ask for 10 years of experience when the technology has been in the market for 5 years only, or they publish a junior dev opening with implausible requirements.
- Tech companies with impossible interview challenges that test for skills you will never use again in your job or life. Or companies that may hire you but don't want to pay any salary because you don't have experience.
- Shitty bosses that don't want to give you opportunities to grow; they rather pay you less and keep you in your current role.
- Youtuber's: They  do videos that make everything look easy, they make 6 hour videos impossible to follow, they publish course after course like you will win if you learn 100 languages and tools.
- Job portals: almost all of them are broken, badly implemented, it's impossible to be visible, its to easy to apply so everyone applies without reading, etc.
- Other applicants: always lying on their resumes
- The government: with inmigration laws that block your opportunities.
- Influencers: Usually giving you innocent or toxic advice like: Asking you to learn millions of libraries, telling you that if you don't learn X or Y you will be left behind, or involving you on stupid language wars (E.g: PHP vs JS), or talking about fancy computer setups, 
- Toxic family and friends that don't support you or give you a hard time when you need to focus on learning.
